To find the value of the integral ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx, we can use the trigonometric substitution method. Let x = tan(θ), then dx = sec^2(θ) dθ. Substituting these into the integral, we get ∫(1/√(1 + tan^2(θ))) sec^2(θ) dθ = ∫(1/√(sec^2(θ))) sec^2(θ) dθ = ∫sec(θ) dθ. This integral is a standard form and can be solved using the formula ∫sec(θ) dθ = ln|sec(θ) + tan(θ)| + C. Substituting back x = tan(θ), we get the final answer as ln|x + √(1 + x^2)| + C.\n\n2. To find the value of the integral ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx, we can use the hyperbolic substitution method. Let x = sinh(θ), then dx = cosh(θ) dθ. Substituting these into the integral, we get ∫(1/√(1 + sinh^2(θ))) cosh(θ) dθ = ∫(1/√(cosh^2(θ))) cosh(θ) dθ = ∫dθ. This integral is a standard form and can be solved using the formula ∫dθ = θ + C. Substituting back x = sinh(θ), we get the final answer as arcsinh(x) + C.\n\n3. To find the value of the integral ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx, we can use the Euler substitution method. Let x = tanh(θ), then dx = sech^2(θ) dθ. Substituting these into the integral, we get ∫(1/√(1 + tanh^2(θ))) sech^2(θ) dθ = ∫(1/√(sech^2(θ))) sech^2(θ) dθ = ∫dθ. This integral is a standard form and can be solved using the formula ∫dθ = θ + C. Substituting back x = tanh(θ), we get the final answer as arctanh(x) + C.\n\n4. To find the value of the integral ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx, we can use the Weierstrass substitution method. Let x = tan(θ/2), then dx = (1/2)sec^2(θ/2) dθ. Substituting these into the integral, we get ∫(1/√(1 + tan^2(θ/2))) (1/2)sec^2(θ/2) dθ = ∫(1/√(sec^2(θ/2))) (1/2)sec^2(θ/2) dθ = ∫(1/2) dθ. This integral is a standard form and can be solved using the formula ∫(1/2) dθ = (1/2)θ + C. Substituting back x = tan(θ/2), we get the final answer as (1/2)arctan(x) + C.\n\n5. To find the value of the integral ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx, we can use the integration by parts method. Let u = 1/√(1 + x^2) and dv = dx, then du = -x/(1 + x^2)^(3/2) dx and v = x. Substituting these into the integral, we get ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx = uv - ∫v du = x/√(1 + x^2) + ∫(x^2/(1 + x^2)^(3/2)) dx. This integral can be solved using the trigonometric substitution method, and the final answer is ln|x + √(1 + x^2)| + C.\n\n6. To find the value of the integral ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx, we can use the integration by substitution method. Let u = 1 + x^2, then du = 2x dx. Substituting these into the integral, we get ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx = (1/2) ∫(1/√u) du = √u + C. Substituting back u = 1 + x^2, we get the final answer as √(1 + x^2) + C.\n\n7. To find the value of the integral ∫(1/√(1 + x^2)) dx, we can use the integration by parts method. Let u = 1/√(1 + x^2) and dv = dx, then du = -x/(1 + x^2)^(3/2) dx and v = x.

If orthocenter is (2, 5/2), centroid is (c,d), find c + 2d:\nassistant\nThe orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the three altitudes of the triangle intersect. The centroid is the point where the three medians of the triangle intersect. The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. The orthocenter, centroid, and circumcenter of a triangle are collinear, and the centroid divides the line segment joining the orthocenter and the circumcenter in the ratio 2:1. The coordinates of the centroid (c, d) of a triangle with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) are given by:\n\\[ c = \\frac{x1 + x2 + x3}{3}, \\quad d = \\frac{y1 + y2 + y3}{3} \\]\nGiven the orthocenter (2, 5/2) and the centroid (c, d), we can use the fact that the centroid divides the line segment joining the orthocenter and the circumcenter in the ratio 2:1. However, we don't need the circumcenter to find c + 2d. We can directly use the coordinates of the orthocenter and the centroid to find c and d. Since the centroid divides the line segment joining the orthocenter and the circumcenter in the ratio 2:1, we can use the section formula to find the coordinates of the centroid. But in this case, we can directly use the given information to find c and d. The coordinates of the centroid are:\n\\[ c = \\frac{5 + (-2) + a}{3} = \\frac{3 + a}{3}, \\quad d = \\frac{4 + 4 + b}{3} = \\frac{8 + b}{3} \\]\nWe are given that the orthocenter is (2, 5/2), and we need to find c + 2d.
