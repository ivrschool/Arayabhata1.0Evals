Since \\(\\det(3A) = 3^3 \\det(A) = 27 \\cdot (-2) = -54\\), we have \\(\\det(\\text{adj}(3A)) = (-54)^2 = 2916\\).\n   - Next, calculate \\(\\text{adj}(-6 \\text{adj}(3A))\\). Since \\(\\det(-6 \\text{adj}(3A)) = (-6)^3 \\det(\\text{adj}(3A)) = -216 \\cdot 2916 = -630096\\), we have \\(\\det(\\text{adj}(-6 \\text{adj}(3A))) = (-630096)^2 = 396963600000\\).\n   - Finally, calculate \\(\\det(3 \\text{adj}(-6 \\text{adj}(3A)))\\). Since \\(\\det(3 \\text{adj}(-6 \\text{adj}(3A))) = 3^3 \\det(\\text{adj}(-6 \\text{adj}(3A))) = 27 \\cdot 396963600000 = 10717917200000\\).\n\n4. **Match the given form:**\n   - We need to match \\(10717917200000 = 2^{m+n} \\cdot 3^{mn}\\). By prime factorization, we get \\(10717917200000 = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10}\\). Thus, \\(m+n = 15\\) and \\(mn = 10\\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):**\n   - The quadratic equation \\(t^2 - 15t + 10 = 0\\) has roots \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).
