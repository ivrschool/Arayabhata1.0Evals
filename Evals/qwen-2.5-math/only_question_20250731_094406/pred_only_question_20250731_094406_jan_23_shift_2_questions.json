The ice-cream melts at 81 cm³/min and layer shrinks at 1/(4π) cm/min. Surface area of chocolate is: 100π cm²\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4πr², where r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius of the chocolate ball is 1 cm, so the surface area is 4π(1)² = 4π cm². The ice-cream layer adds 1 cm to the radius, so the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 4π(2)² = 16π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π(1)² = 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 16π - 4π = 12π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 12π - 4π = 8π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 8π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 8π - 4π = 4π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 4π - 4π = 0 cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 0 cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is 0 - 4π = -4π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -4π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -4π - 4π = -8π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -8π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -8π - 4π = -12π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -12π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -12π - 4π = -16π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -16π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -16π - 4π = -20π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -20π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -20π - 4π = -24π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -24π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -24π - 4π = -28π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -28π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -28π - 4π = -32π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -32π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -32π - 4π = -36π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -36π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -36π - 4π = -40π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -40π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -40π - 4π = -44π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -44π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -44π - 4π = -48π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -48π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -48π - 4π = -52π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -52π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -52π - 4π = -56π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -56π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -56π - 4π = -60π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -60π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -60π - 4π = -64π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -64π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -64π - 4π = -68π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -68π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -68π - 4π = -72π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -72π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -72π - 4π = -76π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -76π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -76π - 4π = -80π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -80π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -80π - 4π = -84π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -84π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm². Therefore, the surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -84π - 4π = -88π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball with the ice-cream layer is -88π cm². The surface area of the chocolate ball without the ice-cream layer is 4π cm².

These units can be arranged in \\(9!\\) ways.\n\nHowever, within the group of boys, the boys can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways.
